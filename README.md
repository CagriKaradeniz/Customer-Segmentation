## Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation of intenational mobile game company 
I split all customers four segments based on their country, mobile source information, age and sex.
I analyzed each segment's distribution ratio, mean values and null value control.
Finally I predicted new users segments and price information with user's sex,age,country and source datas. 

## Dataset
Dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users.
The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction.
